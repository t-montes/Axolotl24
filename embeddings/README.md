# embeddings
This folder contains the generated embeddings used by the clustering algorithm to find the senses.

## examples
Embedding files for the words within the examples (word embedding).
When row example is not available, it was generated.

## glosses
Embedding files for the [CLS] token of the gloss of the word.
When row gloss is not available, it was generated (also useful for subtask 2).

## concatenated (glosses+examples)
Embedding files for the concatenation of the word embedding and the gloss embedding.
